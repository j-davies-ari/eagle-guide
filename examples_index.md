# Examples of common EAGLE tasks

To help you get to grips with all the details I've covered on previous pages, I'll now show you several examples of how to do some standard "simulation tasks". These should hopefully cover many of the types of analysis you'll be doing when working with EAGLE.

I strongly recommend you go through these in order, as some sections rely on information and/or code in previous ones!
